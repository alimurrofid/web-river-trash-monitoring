# Web River Trash Monitoring

**Web River Trash Monitoring** is a web-based river trash monitoring system designed to facilitate real-time river condition monitoring through cameras installed at strategic points. This system displays AI-based visual detection results sent via **MQTT** protocol and provides live video streaming services through **NGINX RTMP** server.

This platform is specifically developed to integrate with detection devices running on **Raspberry Pi 5** equipped with **Hailo-8 AI** accelerator that has computing power of up to 26 TOPS, as described in the **[river-trash-monitoring](https://github.com/alimurrofid/river-trash-monitoring/tree/main/raspberrypi_hailoai)** repository.

The hardware used is the **[reComputer AI R2130-12](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-AI-R2130-12-p-6368.html)** from Seeed Studio, designed for efficient edge AI processing.

This system integrates AI-based visual detection processes, data transmission via MQTT, and presentation of detection calculation results through a web interface. Detected trash will be classified and counted based on two main parameters:

**Material type**: categorized as plastic or non-plastic

**Physical size**:
- **Meso**: trash with size between 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm
- **Macro**: trash with size more than 2.5 cm to 1 meter

Through this approach, users can directly monitor the quantity and types of detected trash, providing useful information for sustainable river environmental condition monitoring.
